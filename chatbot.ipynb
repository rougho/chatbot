    "We first import modules and libraries we need, such as ChatBot and ListTrainer from chatterbot. Then we create an instance of the ChatBot class and store it into a variable (chatbot here). To train our chatbot to give appropiate response, we start with small amout of data. We simply write a conditional statement usuing while loop that the loop will keep going as long as user have not entered special charachter or string via input, in the loop, user type their message, we store it in a variable named 'query' check if the user did or did not user the special charachter we defined to exit the loop, if they did loop will break and our program ends, if not, we call 'get_response' fucntion from our chatbot instance earlier and pass our 'query' which is the user message to the fucntion and what it will return is the response to the message, the accuracy and quality of the responses depends on the quality and the amount of the data our chatbot got trained with."
