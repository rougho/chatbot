    "<br>In this report, we try to explain the process and methodologies used in the development of an intelligent chatbot system leveraging the Python programming language, specifically using the ChatterBot library. The reason for this project lies in the exploration of chatbot technologies as a means to augment real-time customer interaction across a spectrum of industries. The focal point of this investigation is the ChatterBot library's capacity to facilitate the creation of self-learning chatbot systems with a minimalistic approach to coding.\n",

    "Our objective is to explain the process of building a self-learning chatbot from the ground up, showcasing the simplicity with which Python can facilitate the creation of sophisticated AI-driven applications. We introduce the foundational steps in setting up a basic chatbot framework using the ChatterBot library. The emphasis, however, is placed on the critical phase of training our chatbot, where the quality and specificity of the training data significantly influence the bot's performance and its ability to deliver meaningful interactions.\n",
    "This dataset is designed to enhance a chatbot's ability to address mental health queries, emphasizing the significance of emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It covers the essentials of mental health, its impact on daily life, and the importance of maintaining it for productivity, relationship health, and effective coping mechanisms. Recognizing the prevalence of mental health issues, the dataset also underscores the availability of help and the potential for recovery, aiming to provide comprehensive support through the chatbot interface.\n"

Insight is also provided into the mechanisms by which the ChatterBot library manages training data, alongside a discourse on potential future enhancements, notably the integration of real-user interactions as a means to continuously evolve the chatbot's conversational capabilities.\n"

We simply write a conditional statement usuing while loop that the loop will keep going as long as user have not entered special charachter or string via input, in the loop, user type their message, we store it in a variable named 'query' check if the user did or did not user the special charachter we defined to exit the loop, if they did loop will break and our program ends, if not, we call 'get_response' fucntion from our chatbot instance earlier and pass our 'query' which is the user message to the fucntion and what it will return is the response to the message, the accuracy and quality of the responses depends on the quality and the amount of the data our chatbot got trained with."

Based on the nature of the illness, there are a range of effective treatments available. For any type of treatment, it is essential that the person affected is proactive and fully engaged in their own recovery process.\\nMany people with mental illnesses who are diagnosed and treated respond well, although some might experience a return of symptoms.

      "It is estimated that mental illness affects 1 in 5 adults in America, and that 1 in 24 adults have a serious mental illness. Mental illness does not discriminate; it can affect anyone, regardless of gender, age, income, social status, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or background. Although mental illness can affect anyone, certain conditions may be more common in different populations. For instance, eating disorders tend to occur more often in females, while disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder is more prevalent in children. Additionally, all ages are susceptible, but the young and the old are especially vulnerable. Mental illnesses usually strike individuals in the prime of their lives, with 75 percent of mental health conditions developing by the age of 24. This makes identification and treatment of mental disorders particularly difficult, because the normal personality and behavioral changes of adolescence may mask symptoms of a mental health condition. Parents and caretakers should be aware of this fact, and take notice of changes in their child's mood, personality, personal habits, and social withdrawal.

To make sure we could repeat this test if we needed to and get the same questions each time, we used a fixed setting called random_state. Next, we had to prep this test data so it was ready to go for our chatbot's evaluation. This meant turning each question and its corresponding answer into a format that our test could work with easily. Basically, we created a list where each item was a mini-dictionary with the question and the expected answer. This way, we could feed each question to the chatbot and check if the answer it gave us matched the expected one."

Each class may contain several different medications, which each have slightly different ways of working. Below, you\\'ll find common classes and examples of common medications. The first name is the generic name and name in brackets is the brand name. \\n SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Cipralex), and sertraline (Zoloft) \\n SNRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors: venlafaxine (Effexor) and duloxetine (Cymbalta) \\n NDRIs or norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors: bupropion (Wellbutrin and Zyban) \\n NaSSAs or noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants: mirtazapine (Remeron), which can also be classed as a TeCa or tetracyclic antidepressant \\n SARIs or serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors: trazodone (Desyrel) \\n There are other classes of antidepressants (such as MAOIs or triclycics) that are much older and have more side effects or restrictions. They are usually prescribed when newer antidepressants don\\'t work. Other medications such as lithium, thyroid medication, or antipsychotics may also be prescribed, often in combination with an antidepressant to boost its effect. Antidepressants are not only used to treat depression--they may be prescribed to treat other illnesses like anxiety disorders. \\n Only medical doctors like family doctors or psychiatrists can prescribe antidepressants. If your doctor recommends that you consider antidepressants, keep in mind that most people have to try a few different options before they find the right medication. It can be a frustrating process, especially when you feel unwell, but it\\'s important to find something that works for you! Side effects and benefits can vary significantly between different people, and it\\'s difficult to predict how a medication might work without trying it out first. Everyone responds to them differently. It\\'s very important to have ongoing discussions with your health care team regarding your medication so you can bring up any problems or concerns--or even ask more about how your particular antidepressant works.'}]"
